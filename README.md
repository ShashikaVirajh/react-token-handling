## Motivation

- This project was developed as a reference project to learn token handling with react applications using axios.
- Tried to provide a complete but simple example for the developers who are new to this concept.
- Additionally, error handling, timeouts and retry failed requests features have been implemented.

## Installation Guide

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShashikaVirajh/react-token-handling-example.git
cd react-token-handling-example
yarn
```

- To start the server after installation, run

```bash
yarn start
```

## Tech Stack Used

Typescript - for type safety
Redux tool kit - as the redux library
Axios - to make API requests
Axios retry - to retry failed requests
